Homework from the sixth lesson. The lesson was about OOP so the tasks are directly connected with this theme

Task 1
Create a class called CreditCard with fields account number and current balance.
Create one constructor with two parameters.
Add a method that allows adding a certain amount to the credit card. The method takes the amount as input and adds it to the current balance.
Think about how you should define the input and output parameters of the method.
Add a method that allows withdrawing a certain amount from the card. The method takes the amount as input and subtracts it from the current balance.
Think about how you should define the input and output parameters of the method.
Add a method that prints the current information about the card.
Write a program that creates three objects of the CreditCard class with predefined account numbers and initial balances.
Test scenario for verification:
Deposit money into the first two cards and withdraw from the third card.
Print the current state of all three cards on the screen.

Task 2
Create a class to describe a student in our group.
Class fields: first name, last name, passport number, group name (you can add additional fields if desired, such as age).
Create objects of this class for each student in our group.
Put all these objects into an array.
Iterate over the array using a for-each loop and print the information to the console.
